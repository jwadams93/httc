                                ######## PHASE ONE: Research and Understanding ######## 

1. What is HTTP, really? 
    - What does an HTTP request look like as raw text? Whats in it?
    
        An HTTP request has three main sections
            - the request Line
                - the request line specifies the HTTP method, the requested resource (URL)
                and the protocol version such as GET /path HTTP/1.1
            -the headers 
                - the headers provide metadata about the request, such as the host, 
                user agent, content type, and connection settings
            -the body
                - if the request includes a body, such as in a POST request, it appears after the headers,
                separated by a blank line. The body can contain data in barious formats
                such as JSON, XML, or form data.

            example
                POST /json HTTP/1.1
                Content-Type: application/json
                Content-Length: 30
                Host: http://localhost

                {"id":"499455", "value":"test"}

            example from real world mindex assignment
            > PUT /employee/41822ec7-fd2d-418d-aa85-d868bce67451 HTTP/1.1
            > Host: localhost:8080
            > Content-Type: application/json
            > User-Agent: insomnia/12.0.0
            > Accept: */*
            > Content-Length: 126

            | {
            | 	"firstName": "Jake",
            | 	"lastName": "Adams",
            | 	"position": "Developer",
            | 	"department": "Engineering",
            | 	"directReports": null
            | }

2. What is a socket? 
    - How does a program ACTUALLY send data across the internet to another computer?

        A socket is a "pipe", a memory buffer on the filesystem through wich one process can write data to another -
            except that rather than connecting two processes on your computer, the socket connects a process on your
            computer to a process on someone elses computer over a network.

        There is a system by which the writing process can write data into the pipe and signal that data is present;
            the reading process can be signaled that data is ready to be read, and it can read it. 
            
            Pipes are single-direction, but a process can attach to multiple pipes, so bi-directional data flow can occur simply
            by having two pipes in opposite directions.

            If you combine a bi-directional pipe with a means by which you can address another computer and access a "public pipe"
             hosted on it, then you basically have a socket. On the "public-facing" side, the socket takes the form of a port,
             a numbered sub-address that uniquely identifies the socket; on the internal, process-facing side, the socket
             takes the form of a file descriptor, much as pipes do.

        From geeksforgeeks:

            Socket programming is a way of connecting two nodes on a network to communicate with each other. 
            One socket(node) listens on a particular port at an IP, while the other socket reaches out to the other to form a connection. 
            The server forms the listener socket while the client reaches out to the server.
            Socket programming is widely used in instant messaging applications, binary streaming, and document collaborations, online streaming platforms, etc.

3. What is TCP/IP? 
    - Why do people always say those together?

4. What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS? 
    - This project will only be HTTP

                                ######## Research: ########

Man pages (man socket, man connect, man getaddrinfo)

HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616) - don't need to read the whole thing, just Section 5 (Request)

******** https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-5

    %- The first line of a request message from a client to a server must include 
        - the method to be applied to the resource
        - the identifier of the resource
        - the protocol version in use

    SP = Space (the space bar character)
    CR = Carriage Return (ASCII character \r)
    LF = Line Feed (ASCII character \n)

    %- The request line:
        - [method token] SP [request URI] SP [protocol version] CRLF


Any tutorial on "socket programming in C" to understand the basics

                                ######## PHASE TWO: Minimum Viable Product ########

Make the program connect to example.com on port 80, send a valid HTTP GET request for the homepage, and print whatever comes back.

To do this, I will need to figure out: 

- How to create a socket in C (What header files? What functions?)
- How to connect that socket to a remote server (I'll need the server's IP address - how do I get that from a domain name?)
- How to send data through a socket (it's just bytes!)
- How to receive data back (it's just bytes! Again!)
- How to format a proper HTTP/1.1 GET request (this is just a specific text format)

                                ######## PHASE THREE: Key questions I will encounter ######## 

- How do I turn example.com into an IP address? (Theres a C function for this)
- What is a struct sockaddr (Part of C's socket API)
- My request isn't working (Remember the blank line at the end of you HTTP request)
- How do you know when you're receieved everything?
- What is Host: header? (HTTP/1.1 requirement)
